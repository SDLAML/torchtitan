"""Declarative sharding for OPT MoE.

Upstream replaced the imperative ``parallelize_module``/``ExpertParallel``
plans with ``ShardingConfig`` objects attached to each sub-config, resolved at
``Module.parallelize`` time. Root modules (embedding, final norm, lm_head) and
the per-layer norms are stock upstream modules, so they use the shared helpers.

OPT MoE's attention (``GatedNormSWAttention``) and MoE (``norm_moe.MoE``) are
custom modules, not ``GQAttention``/``common.moe.MoE``, so the upstream
per-module TP sharding helpers do not apply to them, so TENSOR parallelism is
rejected explicitly rather than silently producing a wrong plan -- see the guard
in ``set_opt_moe_sharding_config``. EXPERT parallelism is supported: the routed
experts and router take upstream's EP plans below.
