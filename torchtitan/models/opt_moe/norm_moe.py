"""OPT MoE, built on upstream's MoE primitives.

This used to be a full fork of an early upstream MoE -- its own experts,
router, reorderer and dispatch/combine. Upstream has since rebuilt that around
a token dispatcher, and picked up fixes the fork never got: DTensor-to-local
conversion for the expert weights, FP32 router gradients (not just FP32 forward),
expert counts derived from the routing map instead of a second ``torch.histc``,
and dispatchers for expert parallelism (all-to-all, DeepEP, HybridEP).

So the fork now subclasses upstream instead of duplicating it. What remains
here is only what upstream has no equivalent for:

  * ``norm_everywhere`` -- a norm between the gated activation and the down
    projection, inside the grouped expert GEMM.
  * a configurable activation (upstream hardcodes SiLU).
  * the sequence-wise / batch-wise auxiliary load-balance loss, returned from
    ``forward``. Upstream's MoE is aux-loss-free and steers balance purely
    through the expert bias.
  * per-expert initialization, so every expert draws different weights.
  * router entropy and max-violation metrics.
  * ``loss_mask``, so padding tokens do not count toward load balance.

Not supported: tensor and expert-tensor parallelism.

Expert parallelism routes through upstream's `make_token_dispatcher_config`
(`comm_backend` defaults to "standard" = all-to-all, which falls back to local
dispatch at EP=1). This file previously hardcoded `LocalTokenDispatcher`, which
does local dispatch ONLY, so EP>1 could not have worked however the mesh was
configured -- while this docstring claimed it needed "no code here".

EP is now live end to end: `model.py` sets `enable_ep=expert_parallel_degree > 1`,
`sharding.py` builds routed-expert and router EP plans from upstream's helpers, and
`parallelize.py` wires the EP and edp meshes. The only axis `sharding.py` refuses is
TENSOR parallelism.
