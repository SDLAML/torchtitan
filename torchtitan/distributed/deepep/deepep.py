DeepEP v2 primitives for MoE Expert Parallel, on the unified ``ElasticBuffer`` API.

DeepEP v2 (>= 2.0.0) collapses the v1 two-path design -- high-throughput (HT,
``buffer.dispatch``/``combine``) and low-latency (LL,
``buffer.low_latency_dispatch``/``combine``) -- into a SINGLE ``dispatch``/``combine``
on ``deep_ep.ElasticBuffer``. There is one buffer, one pair of custom ops, and one
``DispatchState`` for both modes; only ``dispatch`` branches. The branch is chosen at
runtime by the GRAD context, not by prefill-vs-decode: ``dispatch_tokens`` forces the
compact path whenever ``torch.is_grad_enabled()`` (training), so the expand path is taken
only by an inference forward (no grad) that also set ``cudagraphable=True`` -- which covers
BOTH prefill and decode. Combine is handle-driven and mode-agnostic.

- training (``cudagraphable=False``, the default; also forced under autograd): ``do_expand=False`` +
  ``do_cpu_sync=True`` -- a compact, deduplicated layout. ``_permute_tokens`` gathers it
  into expert-major order using ``handle.num_recv_tokens_per_expert_list`` for the grouped
  GEMM. Full autograd is provided by the custom ops below (dispatch backward is a combine,
  combine backward is a dispatch). The total received count is data-dependent and needs a
  host sync, so this path is NOT cudagraph-able.
- inference -- BOTH prefill and decode (``cudagraphable=True``, under no_grad): ``do_expand=True`` +
  ``do_cpu_sync=False`` -- the static "one-token-per-expert-slot" expanding layout,
  routing-independent (correct even as gating changes between captured replays) and with no
  host sync, so the MoE forward is cudagraph-capturable. Per-expert offsets come from the
  device-side ``handle.psum_num_recv_tokens_per_expert`` (no CPU sync). Inference-only: the
  expanding layout "must not be backward" per the DeepEP kernels.

Routing scores are applied to expert outputs in plain PyTorch (in ``combine_tokens``,
before the pure-reduction combine op), so autograd handles the score gradient, the custom
ops stay pure communication, and combine works unchanged in both modes (``combine``
ignores ``topk_weights`` in expand mode anyway).

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# HOW THIS BACKEND COMPILES
#
# The opaque EPHandle cannot be a graph value, so dispatch returns an integer
# ``handle_id`` tensor and the handle itself lives in a module-level dict, ``_handle_cache``.
# Resolving it needs ``handle_id.item()``, and WHERE that happens decides whether the
# backend compiles:
#
#   setup_context  -> runs DURING TRACING. There ``.item()`` is an unbacked SymInt, and a
#                     SymInt cannot be a dict key:
#                         File "torch/__init__.py", in __hash__
#                             raise TypeError("unhashable type: non-nested SymInt")
#                     dynamo surfaces this as a misleading "RuntimeError when making fake
#                     tensor call ..." naming deepep.dispatch with every argument shown as
#                     concrete, which is why it took three attempts to find.
#   a CUDA impl    -> runs AT RUNTIME on a real tensor, where ``.item()`` is a real int.
#
# So the backwards are custom ops of their own (``dispatch_backward`` / ``combine_backward``)
# and the setup_contexts save only TENSORS: the handle_id plus shape carriers for the
# outputs. Fakes for all four ops let dynamo trace the whole region, forward and backward.
# hybridep.py and minimal_async_ep/api.py are built the same way and compile for the same
# reason.
#
# Verified under FakeTensorMode(shape_env=ShapeEnv()) with requires_grad=True inputs -- the
# login-node repro that finds this class of bug in seconds instead of an sbatch cycle --
# both with capture_dynamic_output_shape_ops left False (dynamo graph-breaks at the
# data-dependent dispatch; deepep runs eager, everything around it compiles) and True
# (dynamo traces straight through). Both reach backward and produce correctly shaped grads.

#
# These fakes return an unbacked (data-dependent) row count, so dynamo cannot trace the
# ops and GRAPH-BREAKS on them: the deepep region runs eager while everything around it
# still compiles. The model compile path is not fullgraph, so that break is legal, and it
# is what 0.4.0 did -- which is why the 100B EP=4 proposal runs worked with
# `compile.enable = True` (launch_scripts/2026-proposal/100b-32-nodes.sbatch).

# converts a working graph break into a hard failure, and being global it would change how
