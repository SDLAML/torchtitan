"""One list of dataset records -> an upstream grain mix.

REPLACES SEVEN INDEX-ALIGNED PARALLEL ARRAYS
--------------------------------------------
The 0.4.0 config expressed 46 datasets as seven lists that had to stay index-aligned
(`dataset`, `dataset_path`, `dataset_inner_name`, `dataset_split`, `dataset_key`,
`dataset_weights`, `dataset_alias`) -- four of which were one value repeated 46 times.
Length agreement was checked by a single `assert`, which is a no-op under `python -O`,
names no field, and fires only after a `zip` has already silently truncated. Inserting a
dataset meant editing seven places or training on a silently wrong mixture.

Here a dataset is one record that carries its own fields, so that entire class of bug
cannot occur.

`alias` DOES TWO JOBS, DELIBERATELY
-----------------------------------
It labels the metrics (`data_docs/{alias}`, carried from 0.4.0's `dataset_alias`), keys
per-dataset checkpoint state across stages, AND seeds the dataset's own RNG. An earlier
draft split the first two into `alias` + `id`, which put two near-identical strings on
every one of 46 datasets to guard a hazard that is better stated as one rule:

    Renaming an alias restarts that dataset's cursor and changes its shuffle order.
    Everything else -- reordering the list, moving the corpus to another filesystem --
    is a no-op.

Neither field exists upstream (`WeightedDataset` carries only `dataset` and `weight`), so
there was no compatibility reason to keep both.
