"""Per-dataset checkpoint state keyed by dataset id.

THE PROBLEM THIS SOLVES
-----------------------
Stage 1 trains on datasets A-E. Stage 2 trains on A-I and must CONTINUE A-E from where
stage 1 stopped, while F-I start from zero. Nothing upstream expresses that:

  * a MAP-level mix stores one fused ``{"next_index": N}`` -- no per-child cursor exists,
    so the request cannot even be represented. This is why every child is an ITER dataset
    (``ParquetStreamSource`` is a ``grain.IterDataset``, so ``SingleDatasetConfig`` takes
    the iter path and grain builds an iter-level mix);
  * an ITER-level mix stores ``{"parents": [cursor, cursor], "index": N}`` -- positional,
    and NESTED under every transform between it and the loader. Restoring a 2-child state
    into a 3-child mix SUCCEEDS SILENTLY, because grain zips parents against states
    non-strictly. Appending happens to work; inserting, removing or reordering silently
    resumes the wrong datasets at the wrong offsets.

The fork's answer until now was an env var, ``TORCHTITAN_MIX_STATE_MAPPING='0-0|1-1|
18-17|...'``, hand-derived by re-executing two config files and matching on
``(key, alias, path)`` -- so moving a corpus between clusters broke it, and correctness
depended on a shell guard on ``SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID``.

THE FIX
-------
Store the dataset ids IN the checkpoint next to the cursors. Then restoration is a
lookup rather than a reconstruction, and reordering, renaming an alias or moving a path
are all non-events. Nothing outside the checkpoint is consulted.
