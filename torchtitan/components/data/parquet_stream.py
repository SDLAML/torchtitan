"""Streaming parquet source: read the rank's rows in order, hold only a batch.

WHY NOT RANDOM ACCESS -- IT IS A THROUGHPUT ARGUMENT, NOT A MEMORY ONE
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Parquet's atomic read unit is the ROW GROUP: one row cannot be decoded without
decompressing the whole group. MEASURED on a real shard (Nemotron-CC-v2/High-Quality,
32768 rows per group): decoding one group costs 0.17 s and yields 111.5 MiB.

A ``RandomAccessDataSource`` must serve ``__getitem__(i)`` for arbitrary ``i``, and
grain's map path hands it a GLOBALLY SHUFFLED index (``dataset.py:144-146`` shuffles the
whole index space, then slices a DP shard). Consecutive requests therefore land in
different row groups, so a per-dataset group cache almost never hits. Measured on the
same shard, 200 rows at uniformly random indices with a one-group cache:

    iter_batches, sequential      342,808 rows/s
    random access, 1-group cache       11.3 rows/s   (9 of 200 cache hits)

That is a **30,000x** slowdown, and it is the whole reason for this source. It is not
fixable by caching harder: with 46 datasets interleaved and a shuffled index inside each,
the working set is the corpus.

The memory number often quoted alongside this (one decoded group per dataset, 46 x ~124
MiB ~= 5.7 GiB per rank) is a SIDE EFFECT of the cache, not the problem. On a GH200 node
each rank has its own ~120 GB Grace CPU, so 5.7 GiB is about 5% of one rank's RAM --
affordable, and no reason on its own to avoid random access.

Streaming removes the throughput problem by construction: reads are sequential, so one
group decode is amortized over its 32768 rows instead of serving one. Holding only a
batch is a bonus:

    read_row_group(0)          111.5 MiB
    iter_batches(bs=1024)        4.5 MiB
    iter_batches(bs=4096)       14.2 MiB

MULTI-EPOCH SHUFFLING WITHOUT RANDOM ACCESS
-------------------------------------------
Streaming does give up grain's map-level index shuffle. It does NOT give up shuffling.
Two orthogonal mechanisms live here, and the measurements say you want both (12800-row
corpus, 64 spans; "disk span" is how much of the corpus a 512-row stretch of OUTPUT
covers; "epoch rho" is the order correlation between two consecutive epochs, averaged
over 3 seeds -- 0 means the epochs are independently ordered):

    configuration                        disk span   #spans   epoch rho
    window 1024 only                          8.0%      6.1   +0.983
    span permutation only                    61.1%      3.5   -0.062
    span perm + window 1024                  78.4%      6.1   -0.080
    span perm + 8 concurrent spans           82.0%     10.2   -0.041
    span perm + 8 spans + window 1024        85.4%     12.7   -0.061

A sliding window ALONE is the bad option, and visibly so: it can move a row at most
`window` positions, so epoch 2 replays epoch 1 almost exactly (rho +0.98) and any output
stretch is still one contiguous piece of disk.

  * `reshuffle_spans_per_epoch` is what decorrelates EPOCHS (+0.98 -> ~0.0). It permutes
    which row-group spans are read in which order, for a few tens to hundreds of spans,
    so it is free.
  * `num_concurrent_spans` is what breaks up LOCAL adjacency, by reading N permuted spans
    at once and drawing rows between them. No buffer of rows is held -- just N decode
    batches -- and reads stay sequential within each span.

Neither needs random access, and neither reads a row group twice.
