"""Per-dataset metrics on the grain path, and the trainer wiring that reaches them.

The 0.4.0 scheduler reached into `dataloader.dataset` to
mutate a live weights tensor. A grain loader has no such attribute, so the trainer used
to die at construction with `'KeyedMixDataLoader' object has no attribute 'dataset'` --
after the dataloader had already been built, i.e. only ever at run time on a real
config. These tests keep that path exercised from CPU unit tests.

The reporting half is worth keeping: `data_docs/{alias}` has no upstream equivalent and
is the only signal that the mixture is actually being consumed in the configured
proportions.
