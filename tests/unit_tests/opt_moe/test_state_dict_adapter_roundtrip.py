"""`to_hf` must not silently drop tensors, and `from_hf` must invert it.

This is a regression test for a real, silent bug. The 0.5.0 port ("Rebuild OPT MoE
attention on upstream's GQAttention") moved q/k/v under `qkv_linear`, renamed
`output` -> `lm_head`, and moved the experts under `routed_experts.inner_experts`
with shape-suffixed names (`w1_EFD` etc.) -- but `from_hf_map` still held the 0.4.0
names. Every renamed tensor therefore missed the map and `to_hf` dropped it,
announcing 21 tensors in / 10 out behind a root-logger warning that a normal run
never surfaces. An exported checkpoint would have been missing attention and expert
weights entirely.

The check is against the ACTUAL model's parameter names, built on meta, not against a
hand-written list -- a hand-written list would drift with the model exactly the way
the map did.
