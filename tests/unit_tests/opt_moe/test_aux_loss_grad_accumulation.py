"""The load-balance aux loss must not scale with gradient accumulation.

opt_moe moved from the fork's ``MoEAuxLoss`` (which returned the aux term up
through ``(logits, load_balance_loss)`` and divided by
``gradient_accumulation_steps`` in the trainer) to upstream's ``AuxLoss``
injection path, where ``NormMoE`` injects the gradient at the layer.

``AuxLoss.inject`` expects an UNNORMALISED per-microbatch sum and divides by the
step's global valid-token count.  Our loss functions end in
``loss_per_seq.mean()``, so ``NormMoE`` converts by weighting with the
microbatch's own valid-token count.

Getting that conversion wrong is silent, and both ways were tried during the
migration:

* weight by the GLOBAL denominator -> it cancels ``inject``'s division exactly,
  every microbatch contributes a full ``coeff * mean``, and the aux gradient
  scales with the accumulation count.
* skip the conversion entirely -> the O(1) mean is divided by ~8.4M tokens and
  load balancing is effectively switched off.

These tests pin the arithmetic that sits between those two failures.
