"""The DeepEP custom ops must be traceable by torch.compile.

`deepep::dispatch` and `deepep::combine` are opaque `torch.library` ops. Without a
fake (meta) impl they raise

    NotImplementedError: deepep::dispatch: attempted to run this operator with Meta
    tensors, but there was no fake impl or Meta kernel registered.

the moment any enclosing module is compiled, so `moe_comm_backend="deepep"` could only
run with model compile disabled. Unlike hybridep and minimal_async_ep -- whose dispatch
outputs are statically sized -- DeepEP's training layout is COMPACT/deduplicated: the
received-token count only exists after a host sync, so the fake must produce an unbacked
symint and every downstream consumer must stay symbolic.

These tests are CPU-only in spirit (nothing is executed, only traced through
FakeTensorMode), but importing `deep_ep` needs CUDA_HOME and the package, so they skip
cleanly where it is unavailable.
